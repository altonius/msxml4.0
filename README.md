MSXML 4.0
========
Scripts relating to the now unsupported MSXML 4.0.

remove_msxml4.0.cmd - is a script that uninstalls both MSXML 4.0 SP2 and SP3, and all additional updates that have been released for them.

More information on the support status of MSXML4.0 can be found at on my blog post titled "[And it's official, MSXML 4.0 SP3 is out of support!](https://altonblom.com/s34e09)"
